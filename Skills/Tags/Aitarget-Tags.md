An ***automatically generated*** document that lists all the aitargets, grouped by tags/functionality.

Tags are added by the wiki editing team and are not a feature that is reflected in the plugin code, but just something more akin to a search aid.

Each aitarget can have more than one tag, and it is listed under each section for all the tags it has.
