If you are having problems with a feature, see if you can find it down below: by following the associated link, you will land on a page that gives you a step-by-step guide as to how to troubleshoot your issue. If you still cannot solve your issue, consider asking for help over our [discord]

## General Guidelines
#### Creative Mode
Never test in creative for whatever reason. It will break most things. Test in survival mode instead.

#### Max Health
Spigot by default limits the max health of mobs to 2048. You can change this limit in your `spigot.yml` file by changing `maxHealth` to a higher number.

#### Console logs deaths
If you are seeing messages in your Console such as "Skeletal Knight was slain by PlayerName" and you don't want to see those, you can head to `/spigot.yml` and set `log-named-deaths` to false, then restart your server.
